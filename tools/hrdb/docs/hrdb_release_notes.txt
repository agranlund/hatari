hrdb Release Notes
==================

v0.005 (December 2021)

- Disassembly view
  - Fix color settings with Mac Dark Theme. (reported by RATI/OVR)
  - New design for row highlighting. Suggested by RATI/OVR.
    - PC row is main highlight colours (usually white-on-blue for light themes)
    - Active Cursor row uses dashed lines
    - Mouseover row is a different background colour (palette "midlight" value)
  - Window limits movement of the address when Follow PC is active.
    - Code tries to keep the window static until PC moves out of visible range,
      this allows you to see the code around the PC in a more stable fashion.

- Memory Window
  - Fixed bug when Lock button is changed. If Lock was applied, window wouldn't re-fetch memory data because of a typo.
    (reported by RATI/OVR)
  - Fixed another bug with locked expressions.
      View was requesting memory for the window before register values arrived,
      so was always behind by a step.

- Graphics Inspector
  - Add "Save Image" right-click context menu item for easier sprite/gfx ripping.
    Image is saved as a palettised BMP or PNG using Qt's image libraries.
    (requested by Shazz/TRSI)
